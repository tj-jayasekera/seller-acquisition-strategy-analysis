🏢 **Business Context**

**Olist** is one of Brazil’s largest marketplace integrators, connecting small businesses to major ecommerce platforms under a single contract.

Sellers:
- List products via Olist
- Ship directly to customers using Olist logistics partners
- Are evaluated via post-delivery customer satisfaction surveys

Two **datasets** from Kaggle were used for this analysis:
- The [O-List E-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) containing ecommerce orders, seller information, customer review scores
- The [Marketing Funnel dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist) containing Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), lead acquisition channels, closed deal timestamps

Together, the datasets and dashboard allow full lifecycle analysis:

Lead acquisition → Deal conversion → First sale → Revenue performance → Customer experience

**🎯 Business Problem**

Olist invests in multiple seller acquisition channels:
	•	Organic Search
	•	Paid Search
	•	Social
	•	Direct Traffic
	•	Referral
	•	Email
	•	Display

But:
- **Which channels scale revenue?**
- **Which convert sellers efficiently?**
- **Which produce sustainable performance?**

The goal of this project was to evaluate acquisition channel effectiveness across the full seller lifecycle, not just revenue volume.
